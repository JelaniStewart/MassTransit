# Job Consumers

When a message is delivered from the message broker to a consumer instance, the message is _locked_ by the broker. Once the consumer completes, MassTransit will
acknowledge the message on the broker, removing it from the queue. While the message is locked, it will not be delivered to another consumer â€“ on any bus
instance reading from the same queue (competing consumer pattern). However, if the broker connection is lost the message will be unlocked and redelivered to a
new consumer instance. The lock timeout is usually long enough for most message consumers, and this rarely is an issue in practice for consumers that complete
quickly.

However, there are plenty of use cases where consumers may run for a longer duration, from minutes to even hours. In these situations, a job consumer _may_ be
used to decouple the consumer from the broker. A job consumer is a specialized consumer designed to execute _jobs_, defined by implementing the
`IJobConsumer<T>` interface where `T` is the job message type. Job consumers may be used for long-running tasks, such as converting a video file, but can really
be used for any task. Job consumers have additional requirements, such as a database to store the job messages, manage concurrency and retry, and report job
completion or failure.

#### When should you use a Job Consumer

If you can get the work done in **less than 5 minutes, don't use a job consumer**. RabbitMQ, Azure, and SQS can easily take a lock on the message for 5 minutes
before needing a relock. This should be plenty of time for most consumers. If you find your consumers taking longer than 5 minutes, its time to start _asking
the question_ if you should move to job consumers. There is a fair amount of bookkeeping involved with Job Consumers so be aware of the extra computational
cost.

## Implementation

To use job consumers, a _service instance_ must be configured (see below).

### IJobConsumer

A job consumer implements the `IJobConsumer<T>` interface, shown below.

```csharp
public interface IJobConsumer<in TJob> :
    IConsumer
    where TJob : class
{
    Task Run(JobContext<TJob> context);
}
```

## Configuration

The example below configures a job consumer on a receive endpoint named using an _IEndpointNameFormatter_ passing the consumer type.

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddConsumer<ConvertVideoJobConsumer>(cfg =>
    {
        cfg.Options<JobOptions<ConvertVideo>>(options => options
            .SetJobTimeout(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15))
            .SetConcurrentJobLimit(10));
    });

    x.SetKebabCaseEndpointNameFormatter();

    x.AddJobSagaStateMachines();

    x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) =>
    {
        cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context);
    });
});
```

In this example, the job timeout as well as the number of concurrent jobs allowed is specified using `JobOptions<T>` when configuring the consumer. The job
options can also be specified using a consumer definition in the same way.

::alert{type="warning"}
The number of concurrent jobs can only be configured using the `JobOptions<TJob>.SetConcurrentJobLimit(int limit)` method. The `ConcurrentMessageLimit` on the
consumer definition must not be used with job consumers.
::

### Job Saga Options

When adding the job saga state machines, the `JobSagaOptions` can also be configured.

```csharp
x.AddJobSagaStateMachines(options =>
{
    options.FinalizeCompleted = true;
    options.ConcurrentMessageLimit = 32;
    options.HeartbeatTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
    options.SlotWaitTime = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);
    options.SuspectJobRetryCount = 2;
    options.SuspectJobRetryDelay = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);
});
```

| Variable                 | Type       | Description                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|:-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FinalizeCompleted`      | `bool`     | Automatically remove completed job sagas                                                                             |
| `ConcurrentMessageLimit` | `int`      | Specifies the concurrency of the job service sagas (not the actual jobs)                                             |
| `HeartbeatInterval`      | `TimeSpan` | Period of time after which a job consumer instance is removed from the active list if no heartbeat has been received |
| `SuspectJobRetryCount`   | `int`      | How many times to retry a job that becomes suspect (not faulted, but the job consumer instance stops responding)     |
| `SuspectJobRetryDelay`   | `TimeSpan` | How long a job should wait retrying when the job became suspect and `SuspectJobRetryCount` is > 0                    |

## Submitting a job

To submit jobs to the job consumer, you can use the request client as shown to request. In this example, the _RequestId_ will be used as the _JobId_.

```csharp
[HttpPost("{path}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> SubmitJob(string path, [FromServices] IRequestClient<ConvertVideo> client)
{
    _logger.LogInformation("Sending job: {Path}", path);

    Response<JobSubmissionAccepted> response = await client.GetResponse<JobSubmissionAccepted>(new
    {
        path
    });

    return Ok(new
    {
        response.Message.JobId,
        Path = path
    });
}
```

```csharp
[HttpPut("{path}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> FireAndForgetSubmitJob(string path, [FromServices] IPublishEndpoint publishEndpoint)
{
    _logger.LogInformation("Sending job: {Path}", path);

    var jobId = NewId.NextGuid();

    await publishEndpoint.Publish<SubmitJob<ConvertVideo>>(new
    {
        JobId = jobId,
        Job = new
        {
            path
        }
    });

    return Ok(new
    {
        jobId,
        Path = path
    });
}
```

## Job Service Endpoints

The job service saga state machines are configured on their own endpoints, using the configured endpoint name formatter. These endpoints are required on _at
least one_ bus instance. Additionally, it is not necessary to configure them on _every_ bus instance. In the example above, the job service endpoint are
configured. A standard __ConfigureEndpoints__ call will suffice to host the job consumers without the job service saga state machines.

```csharp
x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) =>
{
    cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context);
});
```

For a more detailed example of configuring the job service endpoints, including persistent storage, see the sample mentioned in the box above.

## Job Saga Details

The job service uses three saga state machines to orchestrate jobs and keep track of available job service instances.

| Variable       | Description                                                                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JobSaga        | Orchestrates each job, including scheduling, retry, and failure handling                   |
| JobAttemptSaga | Orchestrates each job attempt, communicating directly with a specific job service instance |
| JobTypeSaga    | Keep track of available job instances and allocates job slots to waiting jobs              |

### Job Saga States

A job can be in one of the following states:

1. Initial
2. Final
3. Submitted
4. Waiting to Start
5. Waiting for Slot
6. Started
7. Completed
8. Faulted
9. Canceled
10. Starting Job Attempt
11. Allocating Job Slot
12. Waiting to Retry

### Job Attempt States

A job attempt can be in one of the following states:

1. Initial
2. Final
3. Starting
4. Running
5. Faulted
6. Checking Status
7. Suspect

### Job Type States

A job type has only two valid states

1. Initial
2. Final
3. Active
4. Idle
